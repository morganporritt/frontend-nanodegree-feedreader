# Udacity Front-End Testing Project

This repository contains my submission for the Front-End Testing project of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Project Overview

> In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

For more information, see [spec.md](spec.md).

## Running instructions

Choose one of the following options, and scroll to the bottom of the page to see the output from the Jasmine tests.

### Option 1 - run without a server.

There is no back-end component to this project, so you have the option of simply
downloading the project, double-clicking on `index.html` and browsing locally.

### Option 2 - Github pages

You can view an online version of this project at
[samfrances.github.io/udacity-feedreader-testing](https://samfrances.github.io/udacity-feedreader-testing)

### Option 3 - server

Download the files and place in the document root directory of your preferred server.
